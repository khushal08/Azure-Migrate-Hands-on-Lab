# Line-of-business application migration

Fabrikam Fabrics is a major manufacturer and distributor of clothing and soft furnishing materials. The CTO, James Lynch, was hired 6 months ago with a mandate to address ever-increasing IT costs. He has identified a sprawling IT estate, including a substantial legacy server footprint with 448 servers and VMs identified to date. There is a complex web of dependencies between servers and no-one has a clear view of the entire estate.

The board has approved a plan to migrate as much existing infrastructure as possible to Azure, to eliminate IT infrastructure overheads and 'clean house'. Your team has been tasked with planning and executing this migration.

## Target audience

This workshop is applicable to any technical role with a responsibility or involvement in Azure migration
- IT Professional
- Database Engineer
- Application Developer or DevOps Engineer
- Cloud Solution Architect

## Hands-on lab

In this lab, you will use Azure Migrate to perform an assessment of an on-premises environment with both Windows and Linux operating systems. You will learn how to perform discovery with Azure Migrate, how to group machines and customize assessments to understand dependencies of discovered workloads and how to determine cost.

You will then learn how to migrate servers from an on-premises environment to Azure using Azure Migrate. This includes setting up the Azure environment, configuring replication, and performing a test failover.

You will also learn to use the Data Migration Assistant to perform assessments of databases and migrate database schemas and content to Azure.

At the end of this lab, you will be better able to execute migrations to Azure.
